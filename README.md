# Data Science - BPI Challenge 2017
Data analysis, graphic visualization and creation of prediction models using a database provided by BPI Challenge 2017.


# Main Objective
The main objective is to practice knowledge of Data Analysis, Machine Learning and Statistics. 
For this, a Business Process Intelligence (BPI) data set was selected.

# About Dataset

The dataset was found on the [website](https://www.win.tue.nl/bpi/doku.php?id=2017:challenge) of the 13th International Business Process Intelligence Workshop 2017.

The logs refer to a loan application process of a Dutch financial institute. The data includes all the loan process logs including offers made by the company for accepted loan applications.

For more information about the data, you can consult the [event page](https://www.win.tue.nl/bpi/doku.php?id=2017:challenge) in the 'The Data' section or directly in the [page](https://data.4tu.nl/articles/BPI_Challenge_2017/12696884) of the dataset.


# Results

Some exploratory data analyzes were performed with graphical visualizations and construction of models to make some predictions, to answer the following questions:

    1: What is the frequency of accepted offers?
    2: Offers with less than requested value are more likely to be rejected?
    3: Which loan goal had the highest number of declined offers?
    4: Predict whether the loan will be successful at the end of the process.
    5: Predict the value of the offer to be received by an application.

The result was satisfactory for the main objective.
